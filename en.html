    <p class="textt">A little less than 100 km separates the urban village of Mir (Grodno region) from Minsk. Here is a landmark that you have probably heard about more than once - the famous Mir Castle, built in the 16th century. However, it would be wrong not to mention the Nesvizh Palace along with it, because the residence of the Radziwills is only 30 km from it and visiting both usually takes place in tandem.

These sights of Belarus are special not only due to their safety and popularity. They are both included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

For tourists, they are also of interest because in Mir and Nesvizh you can:

Take part in an exciting quest. Gather a team, go to explore the hidden corners of castles and unravel the secrets of their previous owners.
Organize a wedding ceremony. Just imagine: right under the vaults of the castle, you and your soulmate will become spouses. More romantic and hard to come up with!
Spend the night right in the castle. Feel like a prince, settling into a luxurious apartment for the night!
Have lunch at a restaurant. Become a real royalty for a while and taste the dishes of national cuisine according to recipes of past centuries.
So, having admired the beauty of the models as part of a tour of the Museum of Miniatures, go see live the pride of the Belarusian heritage.

<p class="textt">The crossing of the Berezina River became fatal for Napoleon Bonaparte and his troops. The retreating French chose a ford near the village of Studenka (about 90 km from Minsk) to organize the crossing. However, they did not take into account the cold, so the decision turned out to be fatal: more than 8 thousand drowned in the river, and Napoleon's total losses amounted to 35 thousand people.
  <p class="textt">Outcome: Victory of the Russian army; The French crossed the river, but suffered huge losses. Flight of Napoleon from Russia. Loss of combat capability by the French army</p>

 <p class="textt">The Museum of Miniatures in Minsk has its own authentic corner with a Belarusian-style photo zone. And in the Dudutki museum complex, 40 km from the capital, each location is a detailed recreated and restored historical scenery. For example, you will visit a real windmill, try treats from a delivery man (a person who brought grain), taste natural honey, herbal tea, homemade bread and even moonshine.

But a fun adventure awaits children too: riding a cart, getting to know the local zoo and various souvenirs (you can even forge yourself a horseshoe as a keepsake and try to mold a pot on a real potter's wheel). If you are thinking about what to see in the summer in Belarus, Dudutki are waiting for you.</p>

<p class="textt">The memorial complex "Khatyn" is undoubtedly one of the main attractions of Belarus. It is located 60 km from Minsk. Even though this place cannot be called entertaining, it certainly leaves no one indifferent.
    <h1 class="hat">The history of the Belarusian village Khatyn</h1>
    <p class="textt">The Nazis and their brutal hired helpers, in retaliation for the death of several soldiers and an officer of the German army in a shootout with partisans, gathered all the villagers in the barn of Khatyn, and then set it on fire. They called it “collective punishment”, when entire families died alive in the fire. In some families there were seven or nine children, one-year-old and six-month-old babies were in their arms.
There were 26 households in Khatyn. 149 residents burned down, including about 70 children. Two boys survived, hiding in the forest before the arson, two girls who got out of the fire (they later died in another village that gave shelter to the wounded), two boys injured in the fire - one was covered by her dying mother, the other, wounded, was mistaken for a corpse by enemies .

One adult also survived - Joseph Kaminsky. He woke up when the punishers had already left. He came to his senses to face another tragedy - to find among the burnt seriously wounded only son. The exhausted father took his son in his arms in the blind hope of saving him from the inevitable. But the son soon died in his arms.

</p>

 <p class="textt">The mournful memorial preserves the memory not only of this village, but also of other 185 villages that suffered the same fate.</p>

<p class="textt">The historical and cultural complex "Stalin's Line" is one of the most grandiose fortification ensembles on the territory of Belarus. It was created on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War on the initiative of the Afghan Memory Charitable Foundation with the support of the President of the Republic of Belarus. The complex was created by the method of folk construction, in which state and public organizations, enterprises of various forms of ownership, and enthusiasts took part. The main burden of work on the creation of the museum fell on the shoulders of the engineering troops of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus. The complex was opened on June 30, 2005. It is intended not only to perpetuate the grandiose system of defensive fortifications of the Stalin Line regions, but also to become a symbol of the heroic struggle of the Soviet people against the Nazi invaders.</p>

<p class="textt">
The history of mankind knows many periods of prosperous or vice versa - completely unfavorable for the development of one or another type of human activity. No one will be surprised by the statement that the beginning of the 90s of the last century was not the best time for the theater. Past values ​​were declared unnecessary and obsolete, and the theater instead of "a pulpit from which one can sometimes say good things to the world" could simply be renamed into a sad moralizer.
At this time, the Mozyr experimental theater "Verasen" was created on the basis of the folk theater, which had been working in Mozyr since the beginning of the 50s. Andrey LAZAROVSKY, a legend of theatrical Polissya, a truly people's artist, worked in the theater for many years. The folk theater reached its peak under the leadership of Mikhail KOLOS, a graduate of the Moscow Shchukin Theater School. The People's Theater in Mozyr participated many times and became a laureate of All-Union festivals and competitions. The play "The Ruined Nest" based on the play by Yanka Kupala was shown on the stage of the Kremlin Theater in 1967.
In 1991, Sergei KLIMENKO became the artistic director and director of the theater. During his leadership, the theater, more than ever, lives up to its name "experimental". "Verasen" modernizes Belarusian classical dramaturgy and tries to bring the conflict of modern Belarusian dramas closer to the level of classics. During this period, masters of modern Belarusian stage direction - M. Trukhan V. BARKOVSKII, N. Dinov, V. Korotkevich - introduced their productions into the life of the theater. In 1994, Valery LOSOVSKY became the artistic director of the theater, who had the idea to give the theater the name of the People's Writer of Belarus, our illustrious countryman Ivan MELEZH.
In 1998, Maria POTAPIEVA was appointed to the position of director, who in a very short time was able to do more for the theater than all her predecessors put together. Thanks to her, the theater building, which is an architectural monument, was reconstructed. In 1999, she invites the young director Roman TSYRKIN to the post of chief director of the Mozyr Drama Theater named after I. Melezh. He is trying to carry out a kind of reform in the theater's repertoire policy. Before that, the theater exclusively turned to modern and classical plays of the Belarusian dramaturgy. Now the repertoire has been replenished with plays by foreign and Russian playwrights, classics and contemporaries. For the first time in Belarus, the theater staged such plays as "Antigone in New York" by J. Glovatsky and "Love in the Baroque Style" by J. Stelmakh. In the current repertoire of the theater there are productions of domestic classics and foreign drama: "If Adam had not sinned" by V. Golubok and L. Rodevich, "The Love of Anna Chernushka" by A. Petrashkevich (based on the novel by I. Melezh "People in the Swamp"), " Poison" (based on the play by Y. Kolas "Antos Lata"), "Tribunal" by A. Makayonka, "Trouble from a Gentle Heart" by V. Sollogub, "Marriage" by N. Gogol, "Trees Die Standing" by A. Kasona, Passion under the Elms Y.O'Neela, "Uncle Vanya" by A.Chekhov, "Each sage is quite simple" by A. Ostrovsky, "Peacock" by Y. Kupala, The theater is a participant and laureate of theater festivals, including international ones. In 1991, winner of the festival "Student Carols" (performance "Marya" by A.A. Kudryavtseva), participant in the festival "Contact-94" (Torun, Poland with the performance "Welcome to our village" by P. Marchuk), participant Festival "Slavic Theater Meetings - 95" ("Tristan and Isolde" by S. Kovalev), Laureate of the festival "Hope -2001" ("Antigone in New York" Y. Glovatsky), "Slavic Theater Meetings-2003" ("Anna's Love Chernushki" by A. Petrashkevich based on the novel "People in the Swamp" by I. Melezh) and regional festivals of creative theatrical youth (performances "Passion under the Elms" by Y. O'Neill, "Tribunal" by A. Makayonka), participant in the "International festival of performances of one actor - 2004" (Moscow, "The Milky Way" by K. Cherny), participant of the "International Festival of Performances of Small Forms Northern Meetings - 2005" (Nizhnevartovsk, Russia) with the same performance, diploma in the nomination "Memory of the Heart". The theater is a laureate of the IX International Theater Festival "Ethno-Dia-Sphere", which was held in Mukachevo (Ukraine, 2008). The diploma was received by the play "The Ruined Nest". In June 2009, the theater took part in the international festival "Slavic Crown" (Moscow) with the play "Marriage", where he received three diplomas. For many years, Pyotr ZAKHAROV worked as the main artist in the theater.</p>

<p class="textt">The Orthodox Women's Spaso-Evfrosinevsky Monastery is one of the oldest and largest centers of Orthodoxy on the territory of Belarus.

The monastery was founded in 1125 by the granddaughter of Prince Vseslav Bryachislavich (Wizard) Euphrosyne of Polotsk (1110–1173), who is recognized as a saint by the Orthodox, Catholic and Uniate churches. In 1161, by order of St. Euphrosyne, a stone Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior was erected, which has survived to this day and is a monument of ancient Polotsk architecture.

Inside the church is painted with frescoes of the 12th century, which were uncovered during the restoration. In 1161 St. Euphrosyne donated to this temple a gilded altar cross, a masterpiece of ancient jewelry art, created by her order by master jeweler Lazar Bogsha. The cross was lost during the Great Patriotic War. In 1997, the Brest jeweler-enameller Nikolai Kuzmich made a full-size copy of the cross, which is now kept in the Transfiguration Church.

In 1893-1897, a monumental five-domed Holy Cross Cathedral in neo-Byzantine style was erected in the monastery. The temple was badly damaged during the war years, but by the beginning of the 1990s, residential buildings, a refectory, a gate bell tower with a belfry were restored here. In 1992, the monastery again received nuns. The monastery, as before, became the center of the spiritual life of the city.</p>

<p class="textt">Sophia Cathedral in ancient Polotsk is a unique temple among the few Orthodox shrines of the same name in Europe, one of the earliest in Ancient Russia and the first stone one in Belarus.

This ancient monument is included in the provisional UNESCO World Heritage List.

The Cathedral of Sophia the Wisdom of God with a truly special and symbolic architecture was built in Polotsk on the right bank of the Western Dvina in the 11th century. In the middle of the 18th century, it was thoroughly rebuilt according to the project of the architect Jan Glaubitz in the Vilna (Late Belarusian) Baroque style.

However, fragments of masonry, an almost completely preserved ancient foundation, parts of the apse, pillars and walls, as well as amazing frescoes of the 2nd half of the 11th century, have survived from the temple of the 11th century. The cathedral still amazes with its beauty and grandeur.

It is interesting that an exact copy of the St. Sophia Cathedral of the 11th century is also planned to be built on the banks of the Western Dvina, but in another famous city of Belarus - Vitebsk.</p>

<img class="csgo9" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/uavondnkg/image36_-BUPs7M0O.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1673193953860">
<p class="textt">On the outskirts of the city of Polotsk, next to the Spaso-Efrosinevsky Monastery and the military unit, there is a mass grave from the time of the Great Patriotic War - the Peski Tract. During the Great Patriotic War, the German transit camp for Soviet prisoners of war Dulag-125 was located here.

Soviet soldiers were sent to the camp on the outskirts of Polotsk, who fought in the Moscow direction. Belarusians, Ukrainians, Russians were waiting for their fate here.

Hard work, almost complete lack of food and illness left almost no chance of survival. The death rate in the camp reached two hundred people a day. All were buried at the former shooting range. The process resembled a conveyor belt, when the trenches were still being dug on one side, and on the other, corpses were already pouring into them and sprinkled with earth.

Beginning in 1942, the Germans began to open the graves, take out the remains and burn them. The State Commission, which worked here in March 1945, found burnt fragments of human remains in half of the opened pits. Whether it was an attempt to cover up the traces of the crime, or simply there was not enough room for new corpses, no one will probably ever know.

The Dulag-125 camp is not the only place where corpses were brought to Peski. The executed and hanged from the civilian camp "Thunders" were also brought here, and the prisoners of the city prison and the Gestapo were also buried here.

There is an “Act of May 7, 1945 on establishing and investigating the facts of atrocities and atrocities committed by the Nazi invaders and their accomplices during the period of temporary occupation of the city of Polotsk from July 15, 1941 to July 4, 1944”, drawn up by a special commission of inquiry on the basis protocols of interrogation of former prisoners, witnesses, acts on excavations of mass graves of Soviet prisoners of war in the Peski Tract. During the existence of the camp in Polotsk, more than 40 thousand prisoners of war were destroyed in it.

The remains are covered with sand. which is easily washed away by rain. The place is called the Peski tract. Now the wasteland is overgrown with grass, but there is still no rest for the victims. White slivers of human bones are everywhere. Local boys played football here, running right over the bones of their ancestors. The searchers dug out pits to determine the size of the burial. Human bones were found at a depth of up to two meters. Only one grave was 260 by 100 meters.

Descendants must remember that the war will truly end only when its last soldier is buried. Human memory is short, so it will never be superfluous to recall the names of those who selflessly and courageously defended the freedom and dignity of their people.

In May 2010, the Polotsk regional organization of the NGO "Belarusian Peace Fund" applied to the Polotsk city executive committee and the city Council of Deputies with the initiative to build a memorial complex in memory of the victims of fascism "Urochishe Peski". The initiative was heard and supported at the session of the Polotsk City Council of Deputies. By his decision No. 12 of 06/25/2010, the Polotsk City Executive Committee was instructed to create a working group for the construction of the memorial. The Polotsk city executive committee, in turn, decided to build a memorial complex in memory of the victims of fascism "Urochishe Peski". The decision was formalized by protocol No. 575 of September 15, 2010. The source of funding was determined by the local budget, sponsorship and donations from individuals. The construction was supposed to be completed by June 2, 2011.

The Polotsk municipal unitary enterprise of housing and communal services was appointed as the customer of the construction. Control over the implementation of the decision was assigned to the deputy chairman of the Polotsk city executive committee.

At present, the design project of the memorial, design and estimate documentation have been developed, metal has been purchased and a fence has been manufactured, part of the construction and installation work has been carried out (the following have been manufactured and installed: spikes above it and two cipher elements), about 600 million rubles were disbursed. Financing of these works was carried out at the expense of budgetary funds, gratuitous sponsorship and voluntary donations of legal entities, individual entrepreneurs, individuals credited to the target account of the Vitebsk regional branch of the public association "Belarusian Peace Fund". Currently, work on the construction of the memorial continues, but very slowly due to lack of funds.</p>

 <p class="textt">Minsk is a witness and a victim of the imperial ambitions of the Soviet authorities. You can feel it while walking along Independence Avenue - a straight paved arrow that stretches for 15 km and cuts the city in half. The writer Artur Klinov coined the term "City of the Sun" to refer to the Stalinist Empire style in Minsk. Minsk as the main artery of the Big Communist Dream, built in the likeness of Rome. Station square with a "gate", Lenin square, Marx, Kirov, Sverdlov streets - a solid building of an ideal city for life in the opinion of the Soviet authorities.</p>

 <p class="textt">Mozyr is one of the most unique cities in Belarus. There is an atypical hilly terrain here, which gives the classical places an unusual look. In addition, Mozyr is rich in sights. The former Cistercian convent and the church of St. Michael the Archangel stand out in particular.
 Cistercian monks settled in Mozyr in the first half of the 18th century. At the beginning, in 1711, a monastery was founded (today these buildings are used by a furniture factory). Then, in 1744, a nunnery was built, at which a church was erected.
The idea of building the church belongs to Benedict Rozhansky, prior of the Cistercian monastery. It was on his initiative that some of the Cistercian nuns were transferred from Vilnius to Mozyr. Funds for the construction of a stone temple were allocated by Kazimir Sapieha.
The Church of St. Michael the Archangel is made in late baroque architecture. The temple is single-nave, two-level, with a wall thickness of up to 1.5 meters. The Mozyr Church has a unique element of the entrance group - a protective barbican. Such buildings were built for the purpose of defense.
In 1888 the Cistercian monasteries were closed. The church was transferred to the Orthodox diocese and re-consecrated in honor of the Holy Trinity. The church was slightly rebuilt, a wooden bell tower was added to it.
In the early 90s, the temple was returned to believers and reconstructed. Today it is active and open to all comers. The church is located along Gogol Street, which runs along the Pripyat River.</p>

 <p class="textt">Mozyr is one of the most interesting cities in the Gomel region. In addition to typical sights like a church and a church, there are also unique places here. For example, an abandoned mansion of the 20th century, which was used as a hospital for many years.
    The two-story mansion was built in 1910 by order of one of the wealthy residents of Mozyr. The architecture of the building belongs to the Art Nouveau style. The mansion is made of yellow brick in the shape of the letter E. The house is almost symmetrical, except for the left wing, where there is a round tower leading to the roof.
    Even before 1917, the Mozyr mansion was transferred to the needs of the county hospital. There are rooms for 35 beds. At that time, the building was not heavily rebuilt, preserving the unique architecture.
    How did it happen that such an important facility as a hospital became the most popular abandoned place in Mozyr? Nothing new, the building fell into disrepair and was simply no longer used.

 <p class="textt">The highest church in Belarus is 61 meters (a 24-storey building!), and the only one built according to all the neo-Gothic canons. It was erected on the site of a wooden church of the 16th century by the architect Alshalovsky. For the construction, a brick factory was specially organized and, in parallel, eggs were collected from all the surroundings - they were added to strengthen the lime solution. Slate was specially brought from Germany. Here you can find out what a flying buttress looks like - an outdoor semi-arch that distributes the load from the main wall and stands separately (remember Notre Dame de Paris) - this is completely atypical for Belarus. Be sure to listen to the mass (it is in Belarusian, Polish and Lithuanian), and take a walk in the park - it may even be cooler than the church. </p>

The main point of attraction in the city is the ruins of the castle, which stood here in the 12th century. 6 centuries after the first mention, it was destroyed by the Swedes - almost to the present state. Of all the structures, two walls remained - Kostelnaya and Shield - opposite each other. There is a beautiful view from the Castle Hill - you won't find a better place for a picnic. Be sure to visit the house-museum of Adam Mickiewicz, who was born and lived in Novogrudok, go to the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord, perfectly preserved since 1714, pay attention to the Borisoglebskaya church, which is already over 500 years old.</p>

 <p class="textt">Perhaps the most picturesque ruins from our guide. The castle in Kreva dates back to the 14th century. These walls have seen a lot: in 1382, Prince Keistut, Vitovt's father, was killed here, in 1385 a union was signed, in the 16th century the castle repelled the attacks of the Tatars and Muscovites, and already in the 19th century it was no longer considered as a sensible fortification and was abandoned. The ruins were mothballed in 1929 - so they still stand.

Listen to the wind blowing between the walls, go to the beautiful church of Alexander Nevsky or a strict church, find the former temple of the pagans - even though now Krevo is considered a village, there are plenty of witnesses of its former greatness here.</p>

Дворец построил Казимир Пусловский, а его внук Леон лихо проиграл наследство в карты. Здание жгли партизаны, а с 2008 года комплекс все собираются реконструировать – открыть ресторан и ЗАГС. Пока до этого, к счастью, не дошло.

В мощном здании 12 башен – каждая отвечает за один месяц года. «Летние» башни в центре – это самые «хлебные» месяцы – с мая по август. Каждый год два дня солнце полностью освещает одну комнату – во времена Пусловских в это время ней проводились «дни комнаты». Включай воображение, потому что внутренние убранства дворца не сохранились: не увидишь Черный зал, где играли в карты, Белый, отделанный мрамором, где проводились балы, Розовый, который предназначался для концертов. Нет уже ни стеклянного пола, под которым плавали яркие рыбки, ни 132 комнат. Что сохранилось, так это заливной луг и дом-музей Костюшко в пешей доступности.</p>

<h1><a  name="20">Brest Fortress</h1></a>
<img class="csgo15" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/uavondnkg/image22_4vY-X6a5A.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1673193963987">
 <p class="textt">The Brest Fortress was built in the 30s - early 40s of the 19th century at the intersection of the Western Bug and Mukhavets rivers on the site of old Brest. During construction, the entire city was moved to a new territory east of the citadel.

The fortress was located on 4 islands formed by branches of the Mukhavets and Western Bug rivers and a system of canals.

In the center of the fortress is the Citadel, or the Central Fortification, which is connected by bridges with 3 artificial island fortifications. It:</p>
<ul class="castle">
    <li>Kobrin fortification (north-east side)</li> 
    <li>Terespol fortification (western side)</li>
    <li>Volyn fortification (southeastern island)</li>
</ul>
<p class="textt">The total area of the fortress is about 4 square kilometers.

From August 1915 until the end of the First World War, the Brest Fortress was occupied by German troops. In 1921, under the terms of the Riga Peace Treaty, it ceded to Poland, which included it until 1939.

In 1939 the Brest Fortress was transferred to the Soviet Union.

Brest Fortress during the Great Patriotic WarOn June 22, 1941, the garrison of the fortress took the first blows of the Nazi invaders and for more than a month kept the defense in complete encirclement. In the post-war period, for the courage and heroism shown by the defenders of the fortress during its defense, the citadel received the honorary title "Fortress-Hero".

For the people of Belarus, the Brest Fortress is an outstanding symbol of resistance during the Great Patriotic War.</p>
<h1>Brest Fortress today</h1>


<p class="textt">The Brest Fortress is one of the must-see places in Belarus and the biggest tourist attraction in the city of Brest.

After the war, the fortress was not fully restored. A memorial complex was created on its territory to perpetuate the feat of the defenders in 1969–71.
The main entrance of the memorial complex "Brest Hero-Fortress" The memorial begins with a monumental main entrance in the form of a huge star cut into a concrete block. Here you can hear A. Alexandrov's song "Holy War" and the government message about the attack on the Soviet Union by the troops of Nazi Germany.



The architectural and sculptural ensemble of the memorial includes the main monument "Courage", a bayonet-obelisk, the sculptural composition "Thirst", Ceremonials Square, 3 rows of memorial plates with burial places of the dead, ruins and surviving buildings of the fortress, a museum.

<p>The compositional center of the ensemble is the Courage monument, a chest sculpture of a warrior 33.5 m high, on the reverse side of which there are relief compositions telling about individual episodes of the heroic defense of the fortress.

The 100-meter obelisk "Bayonet" is visible from any point of the fortress and is connected with the main monument "Courage" by 3 rows of tombstones. The names of only 216 of the 850 defenders of the fortress buried here are known.

The sculptural composition "Thirst" The sculptural composition "Thirst" depicts a Soviet soldier who, leaning on a machine gun, is trying with all his might to reach the river and scoop up water with a helmet. The monument is dedicated to the courage of the defenders of the fortress, who held the defense for many days without food or drink.</p>

<p class="textt">The main part of the memorial is the Ceremonial Square, where mass celebrations take place.

In front of the ruins of the former engineering department, the Eternal Flame burns.

In the evening, decorative lighting is turned on on the territory of the fortress.</p>

 <p class="textt">The Belarusian reason for pride is the largest and oldest forest area in Europe, protected by UNESCO. Yes, there are bison in the wild here. Yes, you can even hunt them (if you have enough conscience). Yes, it was here that the agreement on the collapse of the USSR was signed. Yes, this is where the Belarusian Grandfather Frost lives (his residence is open even in summer - but his grandfather's suit is light). Breathe the relic air, ride a bicycle, feed the bison in the aviary with bread from your hand, take a look at the Kamenets Tower, which is already more than 700 years old.</p>

<p class="textt">The largest of the European wetlands, which occupies approximately 30% of the map of Belarus. Terra Incognita is the size of a compact country, with isolated villages and indigenous people, the Poleshuks, who have their own distinct language. To feel all the charm of life in Polissya, you need to wait for the spring flood of Pripyat. The ideal option is to take a boat and sail through the Belarusian villages, which are flooded every spring. Choose to your taste - from Turov to Pinsk.</p>

 <p class="textt">The largest forest area in Belarus is three times the size of Malta! Here is the richest flora, a quarter of the plants are medicinal, many are listed in the Red Book. With animals, too, everything is in order - for example, 29 species of rare birds live here. Pushcha is surrounded by three large rivers - Neman, Berezina and Usoy, and therefore the places here are incredibly picturesque. And not particularly accessible - like Svaneti in Georgia. For example, during World War II, 20,000 people hid in Nalibokskaya Pushcha. Be brave or bold and make a march into the thick of the age-old forest. Be sure to look at Lake Kroman, the Lavryshevsky Monastery founded in the 13th century, the Tyszkiewicz estate in the village of Vyaloye and swim naked in the river - here you can afford it.</p>

 <p class="textt">An unknown, but definitely cool Belarusian attraction is the largest spring in Eastern Europe. Take a six-liter and go for healing water. You can try to plunge three times, but get ready to chatter your teeth all day after that - the water is icy even in July. The water has an emerald color - everything looks very picturesque, however, there are always a lot of people who want to take communion. Orthodox religious holidays are always crowded - we advise you to check the calendar in advance. By the way, the legend says that in ancient times the water from the well was spurting with a pillar the size of a man.</p>
